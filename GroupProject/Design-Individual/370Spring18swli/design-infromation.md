1.A grocery list consists of items the users want to buy at a grocery store. The application must allow users to add items to a list, delete items from a list, and change the quantity of items in the list (e.g., change from one to two pounds of apples).

ANS:I create a shoppingListtype class with method:additem(),deleteItem(),setQuantity() and attribute productid,PorductName and quantity.

2. The application must contain a database (DB) of items and corresponding item types.

ANS:Not considered because it does not affect the design directly

3. Users must be able to add items to a list by picking them from a hierarchical list, where the first level is the item type (e.g., cereal), and the second level is the name of the actual item (e.g., shredded wheat). After adding an item, users must be able to specify a quantity for that item.

ANS:I create a productType class with attribute: productType and a product class in inheritance to productType class with a product name.

4. Users must also be able to specify an item by typing its name. In this case, the application must look in its DB for items with similar names and ask the users, for each of them, whether that is the item they intended to add. If a match cannot be found, the application must ask the user to select a type for the item and then save the new item, together with its type, in its DB

ANS:In shoppingListtype class, I add a method :searchByName() allow user to search item by name and do the action of requirement.

5. Lists must be saved automatically and immediately after they are modified

6. Users must be able to check off items in a list (without deleting them). 
7. Users must also be able to clear all the check-off marks in a list at once

ANS:To do requirement 6 and 7, I add the attribute checkoff:Boolean to show the item has been checked off or not. And method checkoff() to check off item and clearCleckOff() to clear all check off at a time.

8. Check-off marks for a list are persistent and must also be saved immediately.

9. The application must present the items in a list grouped by type, so as to allow users to shop for a specific type of products at once (i.e., without having to go back and forth between aisles).

ANS:I add method:searchByType in shoopingListType class allowing user to look at specific type of item.

10. The application must support multiple lists at a time (e.g., “weekly grocery list”, “monthly farmer’s market list”). Therefore, the application must provide the users with the ability to create, (re)name, select, and delete lists.

ANS:I create a manager class with method:createList() allow user create multiple list, and selectList(),deleteList() and renameList() with attribute arrayList<list> to save multiple list.

11. The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and responsive.
